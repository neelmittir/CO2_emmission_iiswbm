The project is about Carbon Emission from Cars (EU-28 data, It contains 26 variables and approx.419000 observations) where from my view Carbon emission rate (e gm/km) is the dependent variable, as it can be predicted using other independent variable. The data contained many missing and many unwanted values. Thus in the pre-processing step, first the data was converted into columns as it was in text format and then using R the rest of the pre-processing was done.
The next step was Variable selection as many of the variables were conveying similar type of information and some were not needed. Thus selection initially by observation and then by statistical screening was done. 
The next step was building a model that can predict carbon emission and for that purpose the data set was divided based on the fuel type used by the vehicle, split up in Training and Testing data and then they were used for prediction as generalized model’s output wasn’t satisfactory.
